# Petfinder: Adoption Speed Prediction

### Problem Statement

With shelters consistently overrun, dogs can wait months to a year to find a forever home and that's if they're fortunate enough to avoid euthanasia. In 2020 alone over 100,000 shelter animals were put down for reasons NOT related to illness or injury. Shelters are doing their best, but studies show that after a month in a shelter most dogs experience long term or permanent behavioral effects from their time in rescue conditions.

**I endeavor to predict timely dog adoptions. I will predict the dogs that will be adopted within two weeks of being published on Petfinder and highlight the most important features in determining this outcome along the way.**
If we can better understand the features with the potential to reduce the amount of time a dog spends in rescue, we can reduce the strain on shelters and minimize the sad practice of euthanizing shelter dogs.
