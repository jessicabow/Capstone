# Petfinder: Adoption Speed Prediction

### Background and Problem Statement

Shelters in California are statistically underfunded and overcrowded. Many are staffed predominantly by volunteers and due to understaffing and protocols, shelter dogs spend much of their time alone. Over 100,000 dogs are euthanized per year in California alone for reasons like shelter overcrowding and extended stays. Shelters are doing their best, but studies show that after a month in a shelter most dogs experience long term or permanent behavioral effects from their time in rescue conditions which can make it harder to find them a forever home..

To tackle this problem I used the Petfinder API and petpy wrapper to collect Bay Area dog adoption data for dogs adopted 2019 through 2020.  I endeavor to discover the most influential features that contribute to a speedy dog adoption as well as what features tend to lead to a dog spending more time in rescue before finding their forever homes. I will accurately predict which dogs will be adopted in less than 2 weeks, and which will not.\
If we can better understand the features with the potential to reduce the amount of time a dog spends in rescue, we can reduce the strain on shelters, provide better services to dogs and humans alike and minimize the sad practice of euthanizing shelter dogs due to lack of space.
